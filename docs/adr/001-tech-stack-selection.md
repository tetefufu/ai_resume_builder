# ADR-001: Technology Stack Selection

**Date:** 2025-08-13  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Deciders:** Development Team  

## Context

We need to select a technology stack for building an AI-powered resume builder that can be developed quickly while maintaining scalability and maintainability. The application needs to handle file uploads, AI processing, and real-time updates.

## Decision

We will use the following technology stack:

### Frontend
- **React 18** with **TypeScript** for type safety and modern component architecture
- **Vite** as the build tool for fast development and optimized production builds
- **Tailwind CSS** with **shadcn/ui** for rapid UI development
- **React PDF** for PDF generation, preview, and manipulation (open to alternatives like Puppeteer, jsPDF, or PDFKit)

### Backend
- **Firebase** ecosystem:
  - **Firebase Authentication** for user management
  - **Firestore** for document storage and real-time updates
  - **Firebase Storage** for file uploads (CV PDFs, generated documents)
  - **Firebase Cloud Functions** for serverless backend logic

### AI Processing
- **n8n** as the workflow automation platform for AI orchestration
- **OpenAI GPT-4** for content enhancement and CV tailoring
- **Firebase Functions** to trigger n8n workflows

## Rationale

### Why React + TypeScript?
- **Fast Development**: Component-based architecture with extensive ecosystem
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript prevents runtime errors and improves developer experience
- **Team Familiarity**: Widely adopted technology with good documentation

### Why Firebase?
- **Speed to Market**: Managed backend services reduce development time
- **Real-time Capabilities**: Built-in real-time database for live updates
- **Scalability**: Automatic scaling without infrastructure management
- **Authentication**: Comprehensive auth system with multiple providers
- **Cost Effective**: Pay-as-you-scale pricing model

### Why n8n?
- **Visual Workflow Management**: Easy to debug and modify AI processing logic
- **AI Provider Flexibility**: Can switch between OpenAI, Claude, or other providers
- **Separation of Concerns**: Keeps AI logic separate from application logic
- **Workflow Versioning**: Easy to A/B test different AI approaches
- **Error Handling**: Built-in retry mechanisms and error handling

### Why Vite?
- **Development Speed**: Hot module replacement and fast builds
- **Modern Tooling**: Native ES modules support
- **TypeScript Support**: First-class TypeScript integration

## Consequences

### Positive
- Rapid prototyping and MVP development
- Managed infrastructure reduces operational overhead
- Real-time user experience with Firebase
- Flexible AI processing with n8n
- Strong type safety with TypeScript
- Modern developer experience

### Negative
- Firebase vendor lock-in
- Potential cold start issues with Firebase Functions
- n8n adds complexity for simple AI operations
- Learning curve for team members unfamiliar with n8n

### Risks
- Firebase pricing at scale
- n8n workflow complexity management
- Dependency on external AI providers

## Alternatives Considered

### Full-Stack Frameworks
- **Next.js**: Rejected due to wanting separation between frontend and backend
- **T3 Stack**: Too opinionated for our specific AI workflow needs

### Backend Alternatives
- **Node.js + Express**: Rejected due to increased development time for auth/database setup
- **Supabase**: Rejected due to team familiarity with Firebase ecosystem

### AI Processing Alternatives
- **Direct API Integration**: Rejected due to lack of workflow management and error handling
- **Langchain**: Rejected due to complexity for our simple use case
- **Custom Cloud Functions**: Rejected due to difficulty in workflow visualization and debugging

## Implementation Notes

1. Start with Firebase local emulators for development
2. Set up n8n cloud instance initially, migrate to self-hosted later if needed
3. Implement TypeScript strict mode from the beginning
4. Use Firebase Security Rules for data protection
5. Implement proper error boundaries in React components

## Review Date

This decision should be reviewed after the MVP is completed or by 2025-12-31, whichever comes first.
